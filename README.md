# MakeUC2021

We learned how to use different AWS technologies like Amplify, SageMaker, APIGateway and Lambda for our project.

We used the Spotify API to scrape Spotify playlists of all of their track information to construct a model of what might be considered ‘retro’. Using SageMaker, we built a machine learning model for predicting whether or not another arbitrary song is retro or not.

We used Amplify to host our front-end website for inputting spotify links. We used APIGateway for connecting Amplify, Lambda, and Jupyter.

We learned a lot through this hackathon, and we’re excited to continue learning more about machine learning. Sam and Luke primarily focused on the machine learning and backend side of the stack while AT built the front end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
